1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.

ans==
    *     =  this is multiplication operator  this is expression
           ‘Hello’ =  this is string   this is value
            -87.8 =  this is float  tis is value
                -   =  this is subtraction operator this is expression
                /   =  this is division operator   this is expression
 = this is addition operator   this is expression
               6    = this is integer  and it is value 



2. What is the difference between string and variable?
 
ans==
          String = it is the sequential characters data type which is wrapped inside single or double quotes 
         Variables =  it is the memory location in which we stores the values inside it 


3. Describe three different data types.

ans==
Integer : it is the data type in which values are written in positive or negative numbers 
eg.  1, 2, 3, -1, -2 ,-3
Strings : it is the sequential characters data type which is wrapped inside single or double quotes  
  eg.  “hello”,”jayesh” 
Float :  it is the data type in which values are written in positive or negative numbers  but values are in points   
 eg. 12.5, 35, 9, -43.5 ,-67.3

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
 
ans==
           Expression is made up of variables and operators and values
            And they use to evaluate the values into single value

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?
ans==
          Expression is made up of variables and operators and values
            And they use to evaluate the values into single value
Where 
Statement represent action or command


6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1

ans==
             Bacon is containing  23


7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
‘spam’ +’ spamspam’
‘spam’ * 3

 ans==
              Spamspam


8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

ans==
           Because variable name cannot be start  with numbers

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?
ans==
           int() = integer
          float() = float
          string() = string

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
‘I have eaten’ + 99 + ‘burritos’

 ans==
           This is invalid character error and string cannot add with integer .
We need to assign variable to this and then so we need to make 99 as a string = ’99’ like this  after that the code will run
