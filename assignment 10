1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?
Ans = shutil copy copies only file where shutil.copytree () copies entire folder and the files in the folder.

2. What function is used to rename files??
Ans = os.rename()

3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?
ans= send2trash use to move the file to recycle bin where shutil modules permanently delete the file

4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is
equivalent to File objects’ open() method?
ans= yes 

5. Create a programme that searches a folder tree for files with a certain file extension (such as .pdf
or .jpg). Copy these files from whatever location they are in to a new folder.

def selectiveCopy(folder, extensions, destFolder):

    folder = os.path.abspath(folder)
    destFolder = os.path.abspath(destFolder)
    print('Looking in', folder, 'for files with extensions of', ', '.join(extensions)

    for foldername, subfolders, filenames in os.walk(folder):
        for filename in filenames:
            name, extension = os.path.splitext(filename)

            if extension in extensions:
                fileAbsPath = foldername + os.path.sep + filename
                print('Coping', fileAbsPath, 'to', destFolder)
                shutil.copy(fileAbsPath, destFolder)
extensions = ['.php', '.py']
folder = 'randomFolder'
destFolder = 'selectiveFolder'
selectiveCopy(folder, extensions, destFolder)
import os, shutil
