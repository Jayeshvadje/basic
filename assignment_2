1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Ans =
True and False are the two values of Boolean data types 
We write them as a = True and  False
	
2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Ans ==
and
or
not

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Ans =
AND = true if both are true     
OR = true if at least one is true
NOT = true only if false

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)
Ans =
False
False
True
False
False
True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
Ans =
1)equal to
2)not equal to
3)greater than or equal to
4) less than or equal to
5)greater than
6)less than

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
Ans =
Equal to -  “ ==” equal to operator we use to check that whether two operand are equal or not,when we are checking that the condition is true or false then we use this operator 
Assignment operator - “=”assignment operator we use to assign the values to the variables, when we have to  declared some values to the variable we use this operator

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

Ans =
print('eggs')
 if spam > 5: 
print('bacon')
 Else:
 print('ham') print('spam')

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
ans =
spam = int(input())
 if spam == 1:
 print('Hello')
 elif spam == 2: 
print('Howdy') 
Else:
 	print('Greetings!')

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?
Ans =  ctrl + c

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans = 
Break = it stops the loop when condition gets apply
Continue = it skips the specified part of the loop when condition meets
 
11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Ans = 
Range (10) = it will print 0 to 9
Range (0,10) = it will also print 0 to 9
 range(0, 10, 1) = it will print 0 to 9 but incrementing the number  by 1

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Ans = 
For loop =
for i in range(11):
   print(i)
While loop =
a=1
while(a<=10):
   print(a)
   a+=1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
Ans =
spam.bacon()
