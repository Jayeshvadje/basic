1. What exactly is [ ]?
Ans =  it is an empty list

2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)
Ans =   
	Spam =  [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] 
Spam[2]='hello'
print(Spam)

Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.
3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?
Ans =   it will gives us   ‘d’ .

4. What is the value of spam[-1]?
Ans = 'd'

5. What is the value of spam[:2]?
Ans = ['a', 'b']

Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True] for the next three questions.

6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?
Ans =  1

7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
Ans = [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]


8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?
Ans = [3.14, 11, 'cat', True]

9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?
Ans = list concatenation means the elements of one list can be added to the elements to the end of the another list.
List replication means the list can be copied into a new list by using the extend() function


10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?
Ans = append function insert the value at the end of the list,
 Where,
 insert function insert the value in the list where we want in the list

11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?
Ans = 1) remove()
      2) pop()

12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.
Ans = The similarity between Lists and Strings is that both are sequences. The differences between them are that firstly, Lists are mutable but Strings are immutable.
Secondly, elements of a list can be of different types whereas a String only contains characters that are all of String type.

13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?
Ans = 
tuple= we assign a tuple by () this and tuples are immutable 
list= we assign tuple by [ ] this and list is mutable  

14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?
Ans = t=(42)

15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?
Ans =	
Tuple to list =
aTuple = (True, 28, 'Tiger')
aList = list(aTuple)
print(aList)
 
List to Tuple =
alist = [True, 28, 'Tiger']
aTuple = list(alist)
print(aTuple)
 

16. Variables that "contain" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?
Ans = they are contain  references


17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
Ans = Deep copy stores copies of the object's value.
	Copy reflects changes made to the new object in the original object
